BUGS:

  - newly added folding is a little buggy; maybe it should be tied to the "lock" -- maybe you never reset the
    list of selected notes until all notes are released.  This would let you do more than 5 notes at a time,
    even if you only have one hand on the midi controller

  - I think the note detection is getting screwed up when the pattern is playing; it seems like it's listening to the notes on and off, and changing the selected notes (only when you have a clip playing in the session view with blgen active)

  - I'm not sure what is doing this -- I saw the live.steps jumping all over the timeline; replaced the timing objects to hopefully fix this?

  - tried to hit "clip" and got "no object selected" errors in the console:

call create_scene -1: no valid object set
call create_clip 16: no valid object set
call set_notes: no valid object set
call notes 48: no valid object set
call note 36 7.0000 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 0.0000 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 0.7500 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 1.5000 0.2500 90: no valid object set

  (I think what is happening is that somehow the JS context is lost, and global variables that were set when the pattern was generated are no longer available)


FEATURES:

- add tons more patterns

- support for slide

- have a way to get some notes in there without a keyboard

- allow for control over max num of accents, including unlimited

- when generating or transposing, fold and unfold the live.step, or zoom to fit

- undo mechanism (maybe 100 undo patterns?)
