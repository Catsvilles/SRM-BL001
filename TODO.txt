BUGS:

  - super-short notes in pattern?  They actually sound pretty cool, but I don't know how they're getting in there...

  - When only "new accent pattern" was selected, any manual edits in the grid I had performed were lost when I hit "regen"

  - tried to hit "clip" and got "no object selected" errors in the console:

call create_scene -1: no valid object set
call create_clip 16: no valid object set
call set_notes: no valid object set
call notes 48: no valid object set
call note 36 7.0000 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 0.0000 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 0.7500 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 1.5000 0.2500 90: no valid object set

  (I think what is happening is that somehow the JS context is lost, and global variables that were set when the pattern was generated are no longer available)


FEATURES:

- add tons more patterns

- allow for control over max num of accents, including unlimited

- undo mechanism (maybe 100 undo patterns?)

- kind of like the idea of a random pattern.  We could add a pattern like "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" to simulate that, but it would only come up occasionally; maybe there should be a special setting for that


NOTES:

- you don't have complete control over the length of notes in the live.step -- you can do 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2.  You can't do a dotted 1/8, for example.  This makes it hard to get just the right amount of glide.  If notes are 2 16th notes apart, the first note will be rounded up to a 1/4 note, causing the glide to go from note 1 to note 2 and back to note 1

  - note detection gets screwed up when the pattern is playing; it seems like it's listening to the notes on and off, and changing the selected notes (only when you have a clip playing in the session view with blgen active)
