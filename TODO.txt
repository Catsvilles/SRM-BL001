BUGS:

  - super-short notes in pattern?  They actually sound pretty cool, but I don't know how they're getting in there...

  - when transposing re-fold

  - I think the note detection is getting screwed up when the pattern is playing; it seems like it's listening to the notes on and off, and changing the selected notes (only when you have a clip playing in the session view with blgen active)

  - tried to hit "clip" and got "no object selected" errors in the console:

call create_scene -1: no valid object set
call create_clip 16: no valid object set
call set_notes: no valid object set
call notes 48: no valid object set
call note 36 7.0000 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 0.0000 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 0.7500 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 1.5000 0.2500 90: no valid object set

  (I think what is happening is that somehow the JS context is lost, and global variables that were set when the pattern was generated are no longer available)


FEATURES:

- add tons more patterns

- allow for control over max num of accents, including unlimited

- when transposing, fold and unfold the live.step, or zoom to fit

- undo mechanism (maybe 100 undo patterns?)
