BUGS:
  - I think the note detection is getting screwed up when the pattern is playing; it seems like it's listening to the notes on and off, and changing the selected notes (only when you have a clip playing in the session view with blgen active)

FEATURES:

- add tons more patterns

- support for slide

- have a way to get some notes in there without a keyboard

- allow for control over max num of accents, including unlimited

- when generating or transposing, fold and unfold the live.step, or zoom to fit

- undo mechanism (maybe 100 undo patterns?)
