- Bugs:
  - sometimes _notes.length = 0 when we hit "clip" - crashes m4l
  - note count not right during clip creation
  - some notes have duration = null when we hit "clip" - fails to write clip
  - hover text is showing on controls beneath the "press and hold" message

- maybe a "lock notes" button so you can let go of the keys

- have option to keep notes and pattern, so you can cycle through accent patterns; thre will be some interaction
  between the "new rhythm" checkbox and the "new notes" checkbox.  If you select a new rhythm, you have to select new notes, so checking "new rhythm" must automatically check "new notes"

- add tons more patterns

- have a way to get some notes in there without a keyboard

- help user discover the keyboard selection (maybe display selected notes on screen?)

- allow for control over max num of accents, including unlimited

- fix the clip mechanism  --- make sure it honors the accents

- add transpose buttons: +12 +1 -1 -12; when transposing, fold and unfold the live.step, or zoom to fit
