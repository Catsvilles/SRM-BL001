- Bugs:
  - sometimes _notes.length = 0 when we hit "clip" - crashes m4l
  - note count not right during clip creation
  - some notes have duration = null when we hit "clip" - fails to write clip
  - hover text is showing on controls beneath the "press and hold" message
  - not sure velocities, durations, etc. are being set properly across all notes in the live.step
  - sometimes I see non-zero pitches with zero velocity (like an unfilled box)
  - edit notes, hit transpose; edits are lost

- add tons more patterns

- have a way to get some notes in there without a keyboard

- help user discover the keyboard selection (maybe display selected notes on screen?)

- allow for control over max num of accents, including unlimited

- fix the clip mechanism  --- make sure it honors the accents

- when transposing, fold and unfold the live.step, or zoom to fit

- undo mechanism (maybe 100 undo patterns?)
