BUGS:

  - initial behavior of live grid is strange -- you get a random pattern until you hit a note, at which point,
the random pattern is modified (but not regenerated).

  - super-short notes in pattern?  They actually sound pretty cool, but I don't know how they're getting in there...

  - when transposing re-fold

  - I think the note detection is getting screwed up when the pattern is playing; it seems like it's listening to the notes on and off, and changing the selected notes (only when you have a clip playing in the session view with blgen active)
  - When only "new accent pattern" was selected, any manual edits in the grid I had performed were lost when I hit "regen"

  - maybe set a max length of glide, so you don't get ridiculous whole notes -- cap it at 1/2 note?

  - swing default value not working

  - tried to hit "clip" and got "no object selected" errors in the console:

call create_scene -1: no valid object set
call create_clip 16: no valid object set
call set_notes: no valid object set
call notes 48: no valid object set
call note 36 7.0000 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 0.0000 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 0.7500 0.2500 90: no valid object set
call note 36 1.5000 0.2500 90: no valid object set

  (I think what is happening is that somehow the JS context is lost, and global variables that were set when the pattern was generated are no longer available)


FEATURES:

- add tons more patterns

- allow for control over max num of accents, including unlimited

- when transposing, fold and unfold the live.step, or zoom to fit

- undo mechanism (maybe 100 undo patterns?)

- kind of like the idea of the random pattern -- at least the one that it starts out with is pretty good.  We could add a pattern like "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" to simulate that, but it would only come up occasionally; maybe there should be a special setting for that
